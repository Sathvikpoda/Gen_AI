Text Chunking with NLTK

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the process of tokenizing text, applying part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and performing chunking using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This example uses a simple sentence to illustrate how these NLP techniques can be implemented and visualized.

Description
The script processes text to break it down into its grammatical components (tokens and POS tags) and then groups tokens into "chunks" based on a defined grammar. This is useful for extracting phrases or other structured information from text.

Key Steps Implemented:
Tokenization: Splits the text into individual words or tokens.
POS Tagging: Assigns a part-of-speech (like noun, verb, adjective) to each token.
Chunking: Groups tokens into chunks (like noun phrases or verb phrases) based on a specified grammar.
Technologies Used
nltk: A leading library for building Python programs to work with human language data.

How to Run
Ensure Python and NLTK are installed, along with the necessary NLTK resources. You can install NLTK with pip and download the required packages using the script commands. To run the script:
python text_chunking_nltk.py

Setup
Before running the script, make sure to download the following NLTK resources:

punkt: For tokenizing text into sentences and words.
averaged_perceptron_tagger: For POS tagging.
averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng: Additional resource for POS tagging in English.
Results
Upon running the script, it:

Prints the tokenized text and POS tags.
Displays the structure of text chunks as a tree, which can also be visually represented if running in an environment that supports GUI displays.
