YouTube Comments Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of scraping comments from a YouTube video using Selenium. The script navigates to a specified YouTube video, loads the comments section by simulating scrolling, and extracts comments and their corresponding authors, saving the data to a CSV file.

Description
The script uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with YouTubeâ€™s interface, effectively loading comments by scrolling down the video's comment section and capturing the text and author of each comment. The comments are then stored in a CSV file for further analysis or archiving purposes.

Key Features
Headless Mode: Supports running in headless mode to avoid opening a browser window during the scraping process.
Data Extraction: Gathers both the comment text and the author's name for each comment.
Data Storage: Outputs the collected comments and authors to a CSV file.
Technologies Used
selenium: For browser automation to interact with the YouTube page.
csv: For writing the extracted data to a CSV file.
webdriver_manager: For managing the browser driver automatically.
