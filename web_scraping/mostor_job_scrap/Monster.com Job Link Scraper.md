Monster.com Job Link Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that uses Selenium to scrape job links from Monster.com based on specific search criteria. The script is designed to navigate the site, extract job links, and save them to a CSV file.

Description
The script automates a web browser to access Monster.com, perform a job search for "GEN AI", and collect the URLs of the job postings listed on the search results page. This tool is particularly useful for gathering job listing links for further analysis or monitoring.

Key Features
Automated Browsing: Uses Selenium WebDriver to control a Chrome browser session.
Dynamic Content Handling: Waits for job elements to load completely before scraping to ensure accuracy.
CSV Output: Stores all extracted job links in a job_links.csv file.
Technologies Used
selenium: For automating web browser interaction.
webdriver_manager: For managing the browser driver automatically.
csv: For writing output data to a CSV file.
