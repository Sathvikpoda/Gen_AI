Real Estate Data Analysis & Recommendation System

🔍 Overview
This script analyzes real estate data and provides property recommendations based on pricing, features, and user preferences. It also applies machine learning techniques to cluster similar properties and generate recommendations using similarity-based filtering.

⚡ How It Works
Loads and processes real estate data

Reads the dataset (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, etc.).
Scales numerical features for better comparison.
Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces high-dimensional data into two main components for visualization.
Performs Clustering (K-Means & DBSCAN)

Groups similar properties based on features.
Visualizes property clusters.
Applies Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm)

Identifies relationships between property features (e.g., high-price homes often have more sqft).
Recommends Similar Properties (Cosine Similarity)

City-Based Filtering → Finds similar homes in the same city.
User-Based Filtering → Suggests properties based on similar user preferences.
🔧 Requirements
Before running the script, install the necessary libraries:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend

🚀 How to Run
Upload the dataset (CSV file).
Run the script in Python or Google Colab:
python script_name.py
The script will analyze and provide:
Clustering results
Market trends
Property recommendations

📌 Features

✅ PCA for visualizing high-dimensional data
✅ Uses machine learning for predictive analysis

📂 Expected Outputs
📊 Property Clusters → Visual representation of similar homes
🔗 Market Insights → What features affect pricing
🏡 Top Recommended Properties → Based on location & user preferences
