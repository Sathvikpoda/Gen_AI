This project involves conducting statistical tests to analyze various aspects of an e-commerce website's performance and customer behavior. The aim is to optimize conversion rates, understand customer preferences, and improve overall business decisions.

Problem Statement
An e-commerce company wants to achieve the following goals:

A/B Testing: Compare two different versions of a checkout process (Checkout A and Checkout B) to determine which one results in a higher conversion rate.
Parametric Testing (T-test): Evaluate if there is a significant difference in the average order value before and after a promotional sale.
Non-Parametric Testing: Analyze customer satisfaction scores to see if there are significant differences between three different product categories (Electronics, Clothing, and Home Decor).
Chi-Square Testing: Investigate whether there is an association between the type of payment method used (Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer) and the type of device used (Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet).
Project Structure
The code is organized to perform different statistical tests as follows:

A/B Testing: Uses a T-test to compare the conversion rates of two versions of a checkout process.
Parametric Test (T-test): Checks if there is a significant change in the average order value before and after a sale.
Non-Parametric Test (Mann-Whitney U Test): Compares customer satisfaction scores between different product categories.
Chi-Square Test: Analyzes the relationship between payment methods and device types.
Prerequisites
To run the code, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

numpy
scipy
pandas
You can install these libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy pandas
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository or download the code files.
Ensure that all the required libraries are installed.
Run the Python script using the command:
bash
Copy code
python ecommerce_analysis.py
Code Explanation
Step 1: A/B Testing - Comparing Conversion Rates
This test compares two versions of a checkout process to see which one results in a higher conversion rate. We perform an independent T-test to check if the difference in conversion rates is statistically significant.

Step 2: Parametric Test - T-test for Average Order Value
We evaluate whether there is a significant difference in the average order value before and after a promotional sale using a T-test.

Step 3: Non-Parametric Test - Mann-Whitney U Test
This test compares customer satisfaction scores across different product categories using the Mann-Whitney U test, which is suitable when the data is not normally distributed.

Step 4: Chi-Square Test - Association Between Payment Method and Device Type
The Chi-Square test checks if there is a significant association between the type of payment method used and the type of device used for making purchases.

Output Interpretation
P-value Interpretation: For all statistical tests, if the P-value is less than 0.05, it indicates a statistically significant result. This means there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
A/B Testing Results: Helps decide if one checkout process performs better than the other.
Parametric Testing Results: Indicates whether the average order values differ before and after the sale.
Non-Parametric Testing Results: Shows if there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction between product categories.
Chi-Square Testing Results: Identifies if there is a significant relationship between payment methods and device types.
