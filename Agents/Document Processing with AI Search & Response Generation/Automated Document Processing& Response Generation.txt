🔍 Overview
This script monitors a folder for new or modified PDF, TXT, and DOCX files, extracts text, splits it into smaller chunks, generates AI-powered embeddings, stores them in FAISS for quick searching, and allows you to ask questions about the documents.

⚡ How It Works
Watches a folder for new or updated files.
Extracts text from PDF, TXT, and Word (DOCX) files.
Splits text into smaller chunks for better processing.
Uses AI to generate embeddings and stores them in FAISS.
Lets you ask questions about the documents.
Uses AI agents to generate structured responses.

📂 Folder to Monitor
The script monitors this folder:
C:\Users\sathv\Gen-AI\python\Python\Chunking\continuous_cunking

💡 You can change this folder path in the script if needed.

🔧 Requirements
Before running the script, install the required Python libraries:
pip install pymupdf langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers openai python-dotenv python-docx numpy

🚀 How to Run
Set up your OpenAI API Key inside a .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the script:
python script_name.py
The script runs continuously, checking for new files every minute.
🛠 Features
✅ Monitors a folder for new files
✅ Extracts text from PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
✅ Splits text into smaller chunks for processing
✅ Uses FAISS for AI-powered document search
✅ Lets you ask questions about the documents
✅ Uses two AI agents to refine responses

📌 Example Output
When a new document is added, the script processes it:
Processing file: document.pdf
Document processed and stored in FAISS for document.pdf
You can enter a question related to the documents:

Enter your query: What is the main topic of the document?
The AI provides a structured answer:
Refined Generated Response:
- The document discusses machine learning models.
- It explains how embeddings work in AI.
- It includes examples of document chunking.

📌 Notes
The script only processes new or modified files.
It runs in a loop, checking for files every 1 minute.
FAISS is used for fast AI-powered search.
Two AI agents work together to generate better responses.
