LangChain SQL Query Generator

This repository contains a Python script that integrates MySQL database operations with LangChain to generate and execute SQL queries dynamically. The script utilizes LangChain's capabilities to construct SQL queries based on given parameters and then executes these queries on a MySQL database.

Description
The script demonstrates how to:
Establish a connection to a MySQL database and handle potential errors.
Use LangChain's LLM (Large Language Models), specifically OpenAI, to generate SQL queries.
Execute these SQL queries against a MySQL database and handle query results or errors effectively.
Key Features
Database Connection: Connects to a MySQL database using user credentials and performs operations.
LLM Initialization: Initializes a language model with LangChain to generate queries.
Dynamic Query Execution: Executes queries generated by the language model and fetches results.
Technologies Used
mysql.connector: For database operations.
langchain: For integrating and using language models to generate SQL queries.

How to Run
To run this script:
Ensure you have Python installed along with mysql.connector and langchain.
Update the database credentials and API key in the script.

Run the script using Python:
python langchain_sql_query_generator.py
Setup
Database: Ensure your MySQL database is accessible and credentials in the script are correct.
API Key: Replace 'replace your api key here' with your actual OpenAI API key.
Results
Upon successful execution, the script:

Generates an SQL query based on input parameters.
Executes the query on the MySQL database.
Prints the results of the query or errors if encountered.
